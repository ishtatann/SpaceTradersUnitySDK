**Name** | **string** | The name of the engine. | 
**Description** | **string** | The description of the engine. | 
**Condition** | **double** | The repairable condition of a component. A value of 0 indicates the component needs significant repairs, while a value of 1 indicates the component is in near perfect condition. As the condition of a component is repaired, the overall integrity of the component decreases. | 
**Integrity** | **double** | The overall integrity of the component, which determines the performance of the component. A value of 0 indicates that the component is almost completely degraded, while a value of 1 indicates that the component is in near perfect condition. The integrity of the component is non-repairable, and represents permanent wear over time. | 
**Speed** | **int** | The speed stat of this engine. The higher the speed, the faster a ship can travel from one point to another. Reduces the time of arrival when navigating the ship. |
